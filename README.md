# L-BFGS-NS
L-BFGS with normalization and sparse second order backpropagation for efficient model updates.


TODO: currently this is in my Ed repository in ed/pytorch/scribe/lbfgs/. Go there for it until I create this standalone project. 
Thanks, and feel free to reach out to me with questions, comments or just to drop by.
